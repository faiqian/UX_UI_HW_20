      <h2>Why I Love Pho</h2>
      <h5>Besides the fact that it's delicious.</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
      <p>Born and bred in the Bay Area, I feel lucky to live in a place with such a rich and diverse culinary landscape. One of my earliest memories of non-Chinese or American food is Vietnamese Pho. I must have been about 3 or 4 years old, watching my mom portioning out some noodles and broth from her big bowl into a little rice bowl for me. </p>
      <p>This seemingly simple, highly nuanced dish holds a special place in my heart. Whether I was drowning my sorrows after a rough exam, enjoying a quiet lunch alone in the middle of a busy workday, or staying out late with friends, the combination of silky rice noodles, richly aromatic broth, and fresh herbs has always transported me to a cozier and calmer state. </p>

      <h2>A Brief History of Pho</h2>
      <h5>From Vietnamese National Dish to Bay Area Favorite</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
      <p>Pho originated in Nam Định province, located in northern Vietnam. Historians believe that the dish evolved from existing noodle dishes in the area, but speculate that the incorporation of beef in the recipe was a result of French colonial influence. It is thought that the word “pho” may be linked to the French “pot a feu”, which also involves beef and a clear broth made from beef bones</p>
      <p>Following the partition of Vietnam after World War II, many northern Vietnamese people fled to the south, bringing pho with them. This led to the development of two distinct styles of pho– the northern style (Pho Bac) and the southern style (Pho Nam). Following the Vietnam War, southern Vietnamese refugees fled to America, bringing their culture and recipes with them. </p>

      <h5>The North & South Divergence</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>

Chicken or dried seafood in addition to beef bones in the broth. The southern style also uses skinnier noodles. Fresh basil leaves, bean sprouts, limes, peppers, and condiments such as hoisin and sriracha sauce are offered on the side so you can customize the flavor to your taste. </p>
      <p>In contrast, the northern style, Pho Bac, features a more simple and savory broth, as only beef bones are used. This style features wider, flatter noodles. Pho Bac may feature sliced onions and green onions, but otherwise does not include extra vegetables and condiments. </p>
